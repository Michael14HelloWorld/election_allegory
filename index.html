        <h1>2016 Election Allegory</h1>
        <hr>
        <p style="padding: 20px;">You can hear leaves crunching under foot as a young man slowly makes his way through the darkly wooded forests of Cesla. Times are changing--life has gotten a lot harder to live. Once, Cesla was a place where the normal villager flourished.
                                                                               ***                                                                                                                            
     The creatures of Cesla, the Cecladeins, were happy and content. They were normal animal creatures such as: monkeys, bears, lions, and even smaller animals like rabbits, mice, and badgers. There were also creatures who took on the appearance of many animals in one, while some had the appearance of humans. But even though the creatures of Cesla were diverse, they all shared in one language, thus making them all Cecladeins. Cesla, with it's soaring mountain peaks, deep valleys, and peaceful life was one that the creatures of Cesla treasured. But then, Barabbas the Barbarian came and took control of Cesla and overpowered them. It has been years since that day, generations have come and gone, and no hero has stepped up out of the masses.
     Thoughts like these were running frantically through the mind of young Jad as he slowly walked along. Becoming angered by the injustice in Cesla his home, his walk slowly formed into a sprint. Before he knew it, he found himself racing through the Cesla forests he had come to know so well. Becoming blinded by tears, he failed to see a small root protruding from the forest floor. Without warning his foot snagged the root sending him flying off the well beaten path he traveled along so often. For a few minutes he just lied in the same spot in which he had fallen--his muscular chest heaving with every breath. 
     As he rested on the soft Cesla grass, he happened to turn his head. There beside him was the biggest tree he had ever seen. Slowly getting up with curiosity, he wondered how he had never seen this giant Terebinth before. Slowly walking around it he noticed carvings on the old tree. Stepping closer, he saw a carving of a Cecladein family--all with a smile on their face. Just underneath the family was a carving of a gold bar sitting amongst precious stones. Looking slightly to the right, he saw a carving of both a scroll and a mouth proclaiming mysterious things. 
     Gently running his fingers over the carved images he muttered to himself, “What does this mean?”. 
     Without warning, a deep, Cecladein voice from behind Jad replied, “It's a picture of the past.” 
     Jad, caught off guard by the voice from behind, spun around and slammed his wide shoulders into the tree in alarmed reaction. There, standing right in front of him, was a huge male lion standing tall and erect. “Who are you?”, Jad gasped. 
     The lion replied with humor in his voice, “No need to be afraid, I’m Aariv. What might your name be?” 
     Jad, still a little stunned, answered, “I’m Jad.” 
     Aariv, who was walking up to the tree, all of a sudden stopped in mid stride, looked up at Jad, and said in unbelief, “Your name is Jad?” 
     Slowly Jad nodded his head with a hint of confusion. 
     Aariv mumbled silently in unbelief, “God has heard us.” 
     Jad, now completely confused, said, “What?”. 
     Aariv, now up at the tree, slowly ran his paw over the old carvings, “Like I said, these carvings are a picture of the past. The Cecladein family symbolizes how Cesla was once a world where families flourished. Things were safe and life was built around family and families were happy. The gold bar and precious stones stand for the wealth that Cesla once contained. But during the reign of Barabbas the Barbarian, our once great wealth has dwindled. The scroll and the mouth proclaiming mysterious things stand for the freedom of speech that Cesla once held within her grasp. But now, as I’m sure you're very aware of, is the fact that if you speak out against Barabbas and what he stands for, there are sure to be consequences.” 
     Jad quietly asked while intently gazing at the old carvings, “Who carved these?” 
     Aariv replied matter of factly, “The Cecladein who carved these was killed many years ago by the treacherous Barabbas the Barbarian. He was a wise old creature who had the keen capability of being able to sense what would happen in the years to come. One day he hurriedly hobbled up to me and handed me a strong box. He told me I was to give it to a young man. I asked who the man would be and he looked me squarely in the eyes and replied, ‘You will know him when you find him.’”  
     Slowly looking to Jad, Aariv said, “You are the young man whom I have been searching for.”
     “I’m still a little confused,” Jad said in lost confusion. 
     Aariv replied, “To clear up some of your confusion we are going to take a little trip to the underground world of the Cecladeins.” 
     Jad just stared at Aariv in stunned disbelief at the comment. He had heard of stories about one such place but had always thought that they were just old legends.
     Turning around and slowly walking away Aariv beckoned, “Follow me Jad, one of the entrances to the underground world is not very far away.” 
     Sprinting with a slight limp from his fall he caught up to Aariv and asked curiously, “What exactly is the underground world of the Cecladeins? 
     Aariv replied and said, “The underground world was dug right after Barabbas became ruler of Cesla. It's a place where true, devote Cecladeins can escape the oppressive rule of Barabbas the Barbarian while at the same time waiting for their true ruler.”
     Jad asked, “I’m a Cecladein, why don’t I know about it?”
     Aariv replied to Jad’s humble question and said, “The underground world of the Cecladeins is only for those who have openly defied Barabbas and need somewhere to flee. It's not something we openly talk about.” 
     Jad said out loud, “I still can’t believe that one of the entrances to the hidden underground world of the Cecladeins is in the very forest that I would play in as a young boy?” 
     Aariv looked in the direction of Jad and replied with a smile, “Yep, as a matter of fact, this is not the first time that I have seen you…” All of a sudden Aariv’s voice trailed off and his wide smile turn into a frown. Without warning Aariv pushed Jad to the ground while at the same throwing his massive body behind cover himself. 
     “Be quiet and don't move!”, whispered Aariv with desperation in his voice. 
     Coming up the trail was some of Barabbas’ solders. Unlike the appearance of the Cecladeins, the Barbarians were quite evil in appearance. Their bodies were the shape of a man but clothed in dark brown hair like a grizzly and their heads and feet were that of a bald eagle.
      The soldiers were not suspicious of anyone else being in the forest other than them so their swords were safely tucked away in their sheaths, however, they were keenly alert. Luckily they walked right on pasted Aariv and Jad without the slightest of thought that they were hiding in the bushes just a few feet away from the path in which the Barbarians were patrolling.
     Once the Barbarians were completely out of sight, Aariv signaled to Jad that it was all clear. “Almost didn’t see them this time.” Aariv sighed.
     After walking for a few minutes Jad asked, “How much further is it to the entrance?”
     Aariv chuckled and then answered, “We’ve arrived.” 
     Jad looked around and asked, “Where?” 
     Aariv slowly walked over to a bunch of bushes, put his paw under one of the roots and grabbed a small handle. In answer to Jad’s question Aariv pulled up a trap door that was geniusly hidden beneath the bushes and motioned with his paw for Jad to climb down.
     Once inside the underground world of the Celcadeins, Jad just stared at this        underground world in total awe. 
     Aariv, however, made his way to what resembled a throne carved out of rock. There sitting on the throne was a small strong box. Aariv nodded in the direction of the strong box and said, “There it is, I think it's about time for the rightful hands to open it.” 
     Suddenly a small group of Cecladeins made their way out of the shadows and started gathering around Jad and Aariv. Jad walked up to the rock throne and with shaking hands picked up the box. Slowly, with Aariv peeking over his shoulder, Jad opened the box and to his surprise, was just a small little scrap of paper lying on the bottom. Jad picked it up, and read it. His once shaking hands became firm and controlled. 
     Aariv curiously asked, “Well, what does it say?” Jad slowly lifted his head, and with a clenched jaw, quoted, “It just takes one man to stand up for what’s right.” 
     Aariv said to Jad, “Barabbas’ rein is almost finished, if you don’t stand up the Beast will, and she’ll gladly take the throne which will definitely ruin Cesla once and for all.”
     Aariv put his paw onto Jad’s shoulder and said, “If you are willing to stand up against the Beast, and her evil forces, we give you our swords.” All at once every Cecladein in the room drew their swords and raised them triumphantly in the air. 
     With an unbelieving look, Jad stared in wonder at all the Cecladeins who were vowing to put their trust in the one who they believed would be their champion. After a few seconds Jad triumphantly replied to their confidence, “With your help, we will make Cesla strong again. We will make Cesla proud again. We will make Cesla safe again. And we will make Celsa great again.” With that the entire room erupted like thunder with the sound of rejoicing. 
     It was about night fall when Jad finally left the underground world of the Cecladeins to go spend what could possibly be the last night with his family in the little village in which he had grown up his entire life.
     Early in the morning Jad gathered everyone in the village together to speak to them. “I’m going to be leaving this village to finally put a stop to Barabbas’ corruption and, what would be if no one stands up, the Beast’s evil rule which would surely be even more severe than that of Barabbas’.” 
     At the sound of this, everyone started murmuring among themselves with comments such as, “This won’t last long.”, “He won’t last a week”, or, “Does he really know what he’s going up against?”. 
     Jad was keenly aware of these comments and with passion said desperately, “When someone challenges you, which the Beast has, fight back and be brutal to the evil and corruption! Don’t just be weak and passive, be tough!” 
     With that the Cecladeins all stood up at once and yelled with weapons waving, “We’re not weak and passive!” 
     Jad screamed in desperation, “Then do something about it! If we all stood up at once, we could conquer this corruption once and for all!” 
     One of the biggest Cecladeins in the group which was about seven feet tall, resembled a grizzly bear, and had multiple weapons strapped to his body stepped out of the  crowd and replied in a voice so deep it seemed to shake the forest, “We tried to fight a gainst Barabbas before he became ruler but it was no use, he defeated us.” 
     Jad replied to the huge Cecladein’s comment and said, “Yes, you are very true, we did try to fight, but did you know that around twenty-five thousand Celcadeins did not fight? And here to find out Barabbas outnumbered us only by five thousand troops. If we would have all stood up, we would have won.” 
     A more smaller Cecladein who looked like a badger standing on two feet said in a rather high voice, “What makes you think they will stand up now?” 
     Jad replied matter-of-factly, “Because we are in a time of decision: free ourselves, or take another reign which will be even more harsh than Barabbas’ reign. Like an old Cecladein once said, ‘It just takes one man to stand up for what's right.’” 
     Pausing for effect, Jad then continued, “This is not so much of a battle against Barabbas as much as it's for towards the Beast, so my question to you is this, who will stand up and help me fight the Beast?” 
     After a minute or two of which seemed like years, slowly, one by one, a Cecladein walked forward until there was none left in the village who had not decided to fight the Beast. 
     As the weeks progressed, Cecladeins who were once passive and thought that their support didn’t mean anything, all of a sudden started standing up while at the same time spreading the word that every Cecladein’s support is vital in order to win against the evil forces of the Beast. 
    After weeks of battle preparation such as strategic war plans, gaining weapons, practicing maneuvers, and studying the Beast’s homeland, the Cecladien’s finally considered themselves battle-ready.
     The Cecladeins thought that if they attacked the place where the Beast was most popular, the Valley of Lost Memories, they could possibly win a great victory. 
     Once dusk came, the Cecladien forces started the thirty-mile march to the Valley of
Lost Memories. They decided to walk there during the night so that they could implement a surprise attack on the Beast. However, somehow word leaked out and the Beast was ready for them. She had her strong, experienced warriors in perfect battle formation ready to wage war against these notorious rebels. 
     The battle started unexpectedly with the Beast striking the Cecladiens first, putting the them on defensive instead of offensive. The Beast had her achers strategically placed around rocks, trees, and even in strong battle formation. At the Beat’s command, the arrows began to rain down on the Cecladeins giving them no warning whatsoever. 
     As the Cecladeins fell down by the hundreds, Jad yelled at the top of his lungs, “Attack!” With that the Cecladein forces rushed forward screaming the cries of battle at the top of their lungs. 
     The Beast, quite surprised at the boldness of the Cecladein warriors, commanded her troops to press forward even though the Cecladeins were showing amazing resistance. 
     Jad had just body slammed a huge Barbarian to the ground when he lifted his head to see the Beast standing tall and erect on a huge rock. This was the first time he had laid eyes on the Beast. The appearance of the Beast was nothing but evil, towering at fifteen feet tall, the Beast resembled a dragon-like creature. The Beast had large, thick scales to protect her from enemies. Her feet and hands were made up of long claws capable of grasping onto anything she wanted. Also, the Beast contained long, bat-like wings in which she used to circle the sky in search of creatures who were weak and vulnerable. 
     With an evil smile the Beast watched as one Cecladein after another fell to the ground in utter defeat at the hand of their enemy. 
     Jad decided the best way to encourage his warriors was to stand up and fight the Beast. Ever so slowly Jad sliced his way through the opposing Barbarians sending them flying to the hard Celsa ground. Finally Jad found himself up at the rock in which the Beast was standing on. Slowly Jad crept up the rock wall, trying desperately not to alert the Beast to his presence. 
     Once on top, Jad stood to his full height and then called out, “Beast, you have had your grippy claws on Cesla for far too long! It's time to see what you’re made of.” 
     The Beast slowly turned around and roared, “How dare someone challenge me!” With that she grabbed some darts which were hanging in leather sheaths on her scaly body and threw them at Jad with precision accuracy. Jad, unexpecting the use of darts, tried to jump out of the way but one ended up hitting him squarely in the shoulder, slamming him into the ground and at the same time throwing his already hurt ankle into a small rock lying on the ground. 
     Taking her opportunity to head in for the kill, the Beast slowly walked up to Jad and said, “You’re not just unprepared, you’re unfit to hold a position as the ruler of Cesla.” Just as the Beast was pulling her sword out of her sheath to end this rebel's life, Jad did a kick up and used that momentum to sink his sword deep into the side of the Beast. 
     The Beast gave a cry so loud that it echoed throughout the entire valley making every eye--Cecladein and Barbarian alike--look up just to see the Beast flap her mighty wings as she took to the sky in escape with the shadow of Jad’s sword in her side.
      All at once the Barbarians retreated with their leader. The Cecladeins, who had now lost ⅓ of their present warriors decided not to pursue. 
     Up on the rock Jad looked down in horror at all the Cecladein bodies strewn about the Valley. With a defeated sigh, Jad sunk to his knees and could look at nothing but the ground. Of the eight thousand Cecladein warriors who made their way to the Valley of Lost Memories, only 5,500 of them was left to walk the 36 mile trek back to the where Aariv and the rest of them were waiting. 
     “What happened, Aariv?” was the question that Jad desperately asked once back home. “What went wrong?” 
     Old Aariv replied, “You were just not as prepared as the Beast was. The Beast has been fighting for over thirty years, and you are new at this, you will make mistakes.” 
     Jad said confidently, “I guess I have have a choice to make: wallow about in the muck of my mistakes, or, learn from my mistakes and move forward--I choose to learn from my mistakes!” 
     Jad walked up in front and stood up on a small rock and faced the questioning Cecladeins, “Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.” 
     With that reassuring statement, Jad, Aariv and the Cecladeins started making strategies once again, this time learning from their previous mistakes.
     As the hours passed, some of the Cecladein leaders had an idea. The leaders decided to present their idea to Jad, “What if you challenge the Beast to a man to beast stand off--loser surrenders and the winner takes the throne.” 
     Jad replied with concern, “That sounds too risky, not that I don’t think I could defeat her, but one wrong move and it could be fatal. That sounds like too much to put on the line.” 
     The leaders replied with smiles on their faces, “Well that's the thing, you’re not going to put anything on the line.” Pausing and exchanging glances the leaders continued, “We will have achers secretly placed about, and then right when you start to fight the Beast, we assassinate her, giving the Barbarians no other choice but to surrender.” 
     At hearing that Jad quickly stood up and said, “We Cecladeins are Cecladeins because we play the hand fairly.” With a mighty shout Jad said, “We don’t cheat!” 
     The leaders slowly hung their heads in shame, while Jad continued, “If we’re going to win, we’re going to do it the Cecladein way--fairly.”
    Meanwhile, back at the Beast’s lair, the Beast was making strategies of her own. Not so much against Jad’s army, but against Jad himself. 
     “We just need to find one thing that will tarnish Jad’s character.” the Beast said in an evil tone. She and her nobles were sitting around a table in a dark cave with only a few torches giving light. 
     “We just need to find one thing which will make people think that he’s not all he says he is.” the Beast growled a second time. 
     One of the Beast’s nobles who happened to be sitting right beside her said in a low tone, “There is something Your Majesty.” 
     The Beast looked his way with an evil smile starting to break across her face.      
     Becoming more confident the noble continued, “Along time ago, when Jad was around nineteen years old, he failed to respect some authority above him, therefore taking the lives of many others.” 
     The Beast replied, “We have found the chink in our knight’s armor.” 
     In just the span of a few days the Beast had had her subjects spread this news, especially to the Cecladeins. After a few more days the Barbarians came back to report to the Beast. 
     “Has our strategy been successful?” the Beast asked with a smile on her face. 
     The Barbarians, a little worried about the Beast’s reaction to the news they were about to give, slowly walked forward with caution and then said, “Apparently, Jad made a big decision to not cheat against you in order to win the throne, thus making him very popular. Our strategy caused him little harm.” 
     The Beast sat stunned and could say nothing, however the Barbarians had more to say, “There’s one more thing Your Majesty, we seem to be losing Barbarians to Jad and his warriors.”
     The Beast clarified, “You mean their implementing surprise attacks without us knowing it?” 
     The Barbarians looked to the ground and then continued, “No Your Majesty, they are joining forces with Jad and his warriors to fight against us.”
     This was the last straw. At the sound of that the Beast became enraged and killed the Barbarian messengers right on the spot, showing her real character like she has so many times before.
     Aariv thought that it would a good idea if the Cecladein forces would send some spies to watch the Beast, see what her weaknesses are, and to just find out more about her. Up until now, she has hid the depths of her life in secrecy. 
     Jad loved that idea immediately, so he quickly equipped five specially trained Cecladein warriors to go on this mission. All five warriors were very aware that this mission could very well cost them their life. With a quick briefing, the five spies were dispatched early in the morning.
     Jad, Aariv, and the others waited anxiously back at the underground world of the Cecladeins. Days, weeks, and even months passed with still no word from the five brave warriors. 
     One day while Jad and his generals were deeply pondering a very tricky battle maneuver, a watchman from above ground came running into the room and yelled, “Our spies have returned!” 
     Jad and the others at the table leaped from their seats and ran to follow the watchman to where he had seen the spies coming.
     Jad ran to meet them and asked, “How was the mission?” 
     The leader of the five spies replied, “It was a success! We have found out some things about the Beast that you, and many others, should know.”
     Back underground Jad asked the warriors, “So, what exactly did you find?” 
     The leader of the warriors leaned forward in his chair and said, “The Beast is the most evil creature in all of Cesla. But first let me start from the beginning: We had just arrived in the Beast’s homeland. Upon gaining some information from the local villagers we found the precise location of her lair. But, there was no way to get inside, the entrance to her lair was guarded beyond comprehension. After a few days of scouting for more entrances to the lair and finding nothing, we became desperate--so we decided to dig a tunnel. The safest distance to start the tunnel was about a mile away. With no hesitation we started right away, knowing this could take awhile. After about two months of solid digging we finally broke through. And here to find out, we actually found ourselves right in the Beast’s office. Seeing no one around we started shuffling through her stacks of papers that she has actually kept hidden from everyone, up until now.” 
     With that the leader pulled a stack of papers from his leather pouch and handed them to Jad. 
     As Jad fished through the papers the leader of the warriors went on, “What you’ll find is top secret documents written by the Beast herself about an Island located off the coast of the Ceclan Ocean. Nobody but the Beast, her cronies, and now us know about this Island.” 
     Looking up from the papers Jad asked, “Why is the Island held in such secrecy?” 
     The leader looked to the other spies, then at the floor, and then finally he looked Jad square in the eyes and said, “The Island is horrific. This is where the Beast takes vulnerable Cecladeins and then does with them as she pleases. Sometimes she has them work like slaves to produced weapons for her vast army, other times she sells them for huge amounts of money, but the last thing she does with them is the worst of all, sometimes they are just used for entertainment. They have specially built arenas on the Island to watch these shows.” 
     The leader ended by saying, “It's about time the Beast is put to a stop.” 
     Jad and his army trudged through the deep Cesla snow on their way the Valley of Shining Sun to wage war with the Beast and her forces once again. 
     As they neared the the Valley of Shining Sun, Jad dispersed his warriors into four divisions with the strategy of hopefully being able to surround the Barbarians. It worked! After about an hour of sneaking closer to the enemy camp Jad eventually blew his trumpet. 
     All at once the Cecladeins attacked the Barbarians causing huge confusion among their ranks. Meanwhile a group of Cecladein archers waited in the forest to watch for fleeing Barbarians. The plan of the Cecladeins was fool proof. 
     As Jad was in the midst of the battle he looked in vain to find the Beast but she was nowhere to be seen, so he lifted his sword high in the air and shouted, “Make Cesla great again!” With that the Cecladeins fought the Barbarians harder than ever.
     After about seven hours of solid fighting, the battle at the Valley of Shining Sun was over and the Cecladeins had utterly defeated their enemies. 
     As the Cecladeins were setting up camp, Aariv walked up to Jad and asked, “Do you know about the Blue Wall?” 
     Dumbfounded, Jad replied, “No, what’s that?” Aariv said, “The Blue Wall is a huge wall guarding the Beast’s castle and her people’s land. Her lair is only a temporary residing place while she’s outside of the Blue Wall fighting. The Blue Wall is what gives her protection.” 
     Pausing for a few seconds Aariv continued, “The only way you're going to win this war is by penetrating the Blue Wall; I think we should strike that next. As long as we penetrate the Blue Wall, and kill the Beast, we will win this war.” 
     A week later Jad and his forces made their way through the dense, Cesla forests toward the Beast’s Blue wall with huge battering rams. There were various little scrimmages along the way as the Beast’s devote people tried to stop Jad’s progress, but they did little harm to Jad’s huge amount of warriors.
          Five hours later the Beast’s Blue Wall came into sight. Jad yelled in a tone of battle, “Battering rams first, footmen second, and bowmen last--attack!” The Cecladeins rushed forward allowing the battering rams to gain full momentum. 
     There was an awful sound like thunder as a few hundred battering rams smashed full speed into the Blue wall. Just as the battering rams hit, the archers from behind started shooting their strong steel tipped arrows up over the Blue Wall to the Barbarians on the other side. The battering rams pulled back and then rushed forward once again smashing headlong into the huge wall. 
     Finally, after a few minutes, a huge portion of the Blue Wall crumbled letting the Cecladein warriors surge through the gigantic hole in the mighty Blue Wall. Inside the wall the Cecladeins met a huge force of Barbarians. After only an hour the Cecladeins pushed the Barbarians back making them call in reinforcements. 
     As the Cecladeins pushed forward they came in sight of the Beast’s castle and also clashed with a huge Barbarian army awaiting them. The sounds of swords smahing swords and flesh echoed throughout the entire hills. 
     As Jad was fighting beside his warriors he found himself once again surrounded by Barbarian troops. Jad smashed swords with the first Barbarian as he rushed forward only to have to spin around and smash an oncoming soldier just in the nick of time. Jad turned around again to see some of his huge, bear-like warriors throwing the Barbarian soldiers to the ground, thus protecting him from certain doom.
     All of a sudden a loud screech came from the direction of the castle. Jad looked up to see the Beast flap her wings as she lighted off the castle walls. Without warning the Beast flew high into the air and then dove in the direction of Jad. Just as she swooped to grab Jad with her claws, Jad lept out of the way nearly missing the Beast’s grip. 
     Jad jumped to his feet to see the Beast standing only a few hundred feet away looking hungrily into his eyes. The Beast once again reached for her darts but this time Jad was expecting it. The Beast hurled three darts at Jad only to hit two of her own soldiers as Jad dived out of the way. 
     Jad quickly picked a rock from the ground and threw it towards the Beast’s face. The Beast dodged the rock only throwing herself off balance in the process. Jad took this opportunity to sink his sword deep into the chest cavity of the Beast. The Beast’s eyes grew big as she stumbled backwards giving a loud screech at the same time.
     Gaining balance the Beast drew her huge sword and roared, “You will die today!” 
     Jad tried to slice the Beast again but her years of experience told her to dodge the maneuver. As Jad tumbled to the ground the Beast stabbed her sword down toward Jad. Jad instinctively rolled to his side just to feel the sword penetrate his shirt and mildly slice his back. 
     With a scream of pain Jad used his sword to slice the Beast’s leg making her step backwards onto a shield which sent her flying to the ground with a thud. Jad quickly jumped to his feet and picked up a bow and arrow which were lying on the ground. Just as the Beast rose to her full height, Jad let go of the arrow which he had keenly targeted at the Beast’s heart. The Beast let out a mournful cry and crashed to the ground as the arrow embedded itself deep in the Beast’s heart. 
     Jad slowly lowered his bow and walked closer to the breathless dragon. It was finished, the war was over, the Beast has been defeated! Jad climbed on top of the Beast and raised his fist in the air and shouted, “Victory!” 
     The shocked Barbarians ran for their life to try and escape the hand of their enemies. However the Cecladeins did pursue this time and defeated every Barbarian. 
     Back at the underground world of the Cecladeins, the place where it all started, Jad stood up and said to the Cecladeins, “It's about us. I pledge to every creature of our lands that I will be the ruler for the Cecladeins and that we will work together to begin the urgent task of rebuilding Cesla.” With that all the Cecladeins erupted in sounds of rejoicing. 
     Out of the midst of the crowd, Aariv slowly walked up to Jad and said, “God has heard us.” 
Jad tilted his head ever so slightly and asked, “A year ago you mentioned something about that when we first met, what did you mean?” 
     Aariv replied, “You know how I said I was searching for a young man who would open the strongbox?” 
     Jad knodded his head in agreement allowing Aariv to continue, “I knew you were the one because of your name. Your name, Jad, means, ‘God has hear us’.” 
     All Jad could do was just look at Aariv in unbelief.
     Slowly Aariv pulled a beautiful gold crown out of a white cloth and said, “I think it's about time the rightful ruler of Cesla wears his crown and sits on his throne.” With that Aariv crowned young Jad causing an eruption of Cecladein cheers once again.
